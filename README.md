# Triangle_Task

Statement
A triangle is defined as a convex hull built on three points in 3D space. As a key feature, the convex
hull of the given points is the set of all their convex combinations.
Given two triangles in 3D space, write a C++ program that determines (true/false) whether there is
an intersection between the triangles. Triangles intersect if they have at least one common point.
